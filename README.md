# About
I am creating this trivia-app with the intention of deploying it on a tablet at an educational booth to quiz users and collect metrics.

# Backlog
- An admin panel with a quiz builder supporting multiple-choice and true-false questions
- Main display where a user can select and take a quiz, recieving immediate feedback per each answer
- Store quiz results on private internal storage
- Metrics visualization within admin panel
