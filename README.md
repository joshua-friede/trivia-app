# About
I am creating this trivia-app with Kotlin for Android with the intention of deploying it on a tablet at a booth. Everything will happen on-device - the owner will be able to set up a quiz in a protected panel that visitors will be able to take.

# Current Features
- Visitor can take a quiz consisting of multiple-choice/true-false
- Visitor will receive immediate feedback after each answer
- App will store quizzes and results on private internal storage

# Backlog
- Owner will be able to build quizzes within the application
- Owner will be able to set the current quiz that users will take
- Owner will be able to view response data and statistics
