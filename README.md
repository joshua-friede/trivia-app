# About
I am creating this trivia-app with the intention of deploying it on a tablet at an educational booth to quiz users and collect metrics.

# Current Features
- User can take a quiz consisting of multiple-choice/true-false
- Receive immediate feedback after each answer
- Store quizzes and results on private internal storage

# Backlog
- An admin panel with a quiz builder supporting multiple-choice and true-false questions
- Metrics visualization within admin panel
